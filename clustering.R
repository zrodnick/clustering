# This mini-project is based on the K-Means exercise from 'R in Action'
# Go here for the original blog post and solutions
# http://www.r-bloggers.com/k-means-clustering-from-r-in-action/

# Exercise 0: Install these packages if you don't have them already

# install.packages(c("cluster", "rattle","NbClust"))

# Now load the data and look at the first few rows
data(wine, package="rattle")
head(wine)

# Exercise 1: Remove the first column from the data and scale
# it using the scale() function
wine2 <- wine
wine2[1] <- NULL
wine_scaled <- scale(wine2)

# Now we'd like to cluster the data using K-Means. 
# How do we decide how many clusters to use if you don't know that already?
# We'll try two methods.

# Method 1: A plot of the total within-groups sums of squares against the 
# number of clusters in a K-means solution can be helpful. A bend in the 
# graph can suggest the appropriate number of clusters. 

wssplot <- function(data, nc=15, seed=1234){
	              wss <- (nrow(data)-1)*sum(apply(data,2,var))
               	      for (i in 2:nc){
		        set.seed(seed)
	                wss[i] <- sum(kmeans(data, centers=i)$withinss)}
	                
		      plot(1:nc, wss, type="b", xlab="Number of Clusters",
	                        ylab="Within groups sum of squares")
	   }

wssplot(wine_scaled)

# Exercise 2:
#   * How many clusters does this method suggest? 3, looks like. Maybe 4.
#   * Why does this method work? What's the intuition behind it? 
# so wss is obviously within sum of squares. That parts just math. First part is degrees of freedom multiplied by the total variance for each item in the set. 
# nc is number of clusters. 
# Then it executes a for loop that recalculates the total within sum of squares based on the number of clusters given by the kmeans function. 

#   * Look at the code for wssplot() and figure out how it works

# Method 2: Use the NbClust library, which runs many experiments
# and gives a distribution of potential number of clusters.

library(NbClust)
set.seed(1234)
nc <- NbClust(wine_scaled, min.nc=2, max.nc=15, method="kmeans")
barplot(table(nc$Best.n[1,]),
	          xlab="Numer of Clusters", ylab="Number of Criteria",
		            main="Number of Clusters Chosen by 26 Criteria")


# Exercise 3: How many clusters does this method suggest?
#3, so similiar to the last one. 

# Exercise 4: Once you've picked the number of clusters, run k-means 
# using this number of clusters. Output the result of calling kmeans()
# into a variable fit.km

fit.km <- kmeans(wine_scaled, centers=3, iter.max=1000, nstart=100)

# Now we want to evaluate how well this clustering does.

# Exercise 5: using the table() function, show how the clusters in fit.km$cluster
# compares to the actual wine types in wine$Type. Would you consider this a good
# clustering?

winetable <- table(wine$Type, fit.km$cluster)

#Pretty good, it only predicted 6 wines incorrectly out of 178, that's about a 3% error rate, not bad! 

# Exercise 6:
# * Visualize these clusters using  function clusplot() from the cluster library
# * Would you consider this a good clustering?
library("cluster")
clusplot(pam(wine_scaled, 3))

#Yes, yes I would.
